[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> 
## The Problem:

The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and
1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the
distribution uniform?

### How I solved it:
```python
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import thinkstats2 as ts2
import thinkplot as tp

num = np.random.random(1000)
pmf = ts2.Pmf(num, label='PMF')
cdf = ts2.Cdf(num, label='CDF')

tp.Pmf(pmf)
tp.Config(xlabel='random number', ylabel='PMF')

tp.Cdf(cdf)
tp.Config(xlabel='random number', ylabel='CDF')
#Output
```

### The Solution:

The random number generator appears to have successfully generated a set of
truly random numbers between 0 and 1. The PMF or probability mass function looks
looks uniform and dense. The CDF or cumulative distribution function is linear
and lacks any obvious peaks and valleys, indicating that the distribution is
uniform, meaning each number between 0 and 1 has an equal chance of being
icluded in the distribution.
